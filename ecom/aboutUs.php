          Hi, I’m <span>CM Shahriar Zaki</span>, a second-semester student currently studying for a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT University. My student ID is <span>s4125820</span>. I have a strong passion for technology, and coding is something I truly enjoy—it’s more than just a skill for me, it’s a way to create and solve problems.
        I’m particularly interested in Web Development. I love working with both front-end and back-end technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. Whether it’s building user-friendly interfaces or developing secure and functional systems behind the scenes, I find it exciting to turn ideas into working web applications.
